            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a Software Developer, I know the importance of maximizing my time and being as productive as possible. I&#x27;ve always been on the lookout for ways to streamline my workflow and make the most of my time. Recently, I&#x27;ve discovered a set of software tools that have transformed the way I work. I&#x27;ve started using Tmux, Yabai, skhd, and LazyVim and they have made a world of difference in my productivity.</p>
<h2>Yabai</h2>
<p>Yabai is a powerful tiling window manager for macOS that has gained popularity among software developers for its ability to increase productivity and streamline workflow. I mostly use it for two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tiling window management: I usually have multiple windows per display open at the same time and rely on Yabai&#x27;s binary space partitioning algorithm to automatically modifies my window layout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts: Yabai allows you to define keyboard shortcuts using skhd or any other suitable software you may prefer. I use this functionality everyday as it saves me from using the mouse when switching between different displays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out Josean&#x27;s <a href="https://www.josean.com/posts/yabai-setup">walkthrough</a> on how to set up yabai.</p>
<h2>Skhd</h2>
<p>Skhd goes hand-in-hand with yabai and makes it super easy for me to jump between my monitors and even windows without using the mouse. I have a single key configured on my keyboard that acts as a hyper key on a press-and-hold. The Hyper key can normally be activated by pressing Shift+Control+Alt+Command simultaneously on macOS. Have a look at this excerpt of my skhd <a href="https://github.com/heyjochen/dotfiles/blob/main/skhd/skhdrc">dotfiles</a> to see how easy it is to achieve this functionality:</p>
<pre class="language-markdown"><code class="language-markdown"><span class="token title important"><span class="token punctuation">#</span> focus monitor 1/2/3</span>

hyper - l : yabai -m display --focus 1
hyper - u : yabai -m display --focus 2
hyper - y : yabai -m display --focus 3

<span class="token title important"><span class="token punctuation">#</span> moves focus between windows in the current focused display</span>

hyper - m : yabai -m window --focus west
hyper - n : yabai -m window --focus south
hyper - e : yabai -m window --focus north
hyper - i : yabai -m window --focus east
</code></pre>
<h2>Tmux</h2>
<p>I usually work in at least three terminals at the same time and my screen got cluttered fast. Since switching over to Tmux, I am finally able create multiple terminal sessions within a single terminal window and switch between them easily. This can be useful for running multiple commands or programs at the same time, or for separating different tasks into separate sessions.</p>
